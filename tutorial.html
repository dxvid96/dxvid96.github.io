        <h2 class="headers" id="sub-heading1">So HTML ... What is it?</h2>
    <p id="paragraph2" class="paragraphs"></p>
        HTML also known as hypertext markup language is a web development tool for creating web pages and documents
        and often is used to define the contents of a webpage or document. It is <strong>not a programming language</strong>
        , it is in fact a <strong>markup language</strong>. The main reason for clarifying this distinction is because
        HTML unlike programming languages has no logic, it is used to as a display tool to show contents of a webpage, whereas 
        programming languages can be used to set processes in place using conditonals such as 'if', 'while', 'else' and so on.
    </p>

    <p id="paragraph3" class="paragraphs">
        This however does not mean HTML is not an important tool especially when referring to web development. Think of HTML as 
        the foundations of a website. The contents, text, buttons, fonts and so on, these are all HTML, and this makes the tool much
        more important to web development than any programming language, given that most programming languages in the context of web 
        development would focus on backend functionality, such as clicking a button that executes some code to open the next page on a 
        blogpost. HTML is focused on the interface of a website, it is a presentational web development tool.

        Tags, Tags and more Tags...
    </h3>

    <p id="paragraph4" class="paragraphs">
        If you are going to be using HTML or working on any web development project it is important to familiarise yourself with HTML Tags, 
        these tags are syntax of HTML and through which the language interprets what kind of content the developer wants to present. It is 
        important to note that some of these tags are <em>'self closing'</em>. Something that will be discussed later on in this document.

        HTML has many functionalities specifically on the frontend side of things. In terms of the contents that are on any
        user interface on a website the tags that are in HTML are useful for inserting different kinds of content onto a webpage.

    <p id="paragraph5" class="paragraphs">
        There are many different types of content that html allows you to populate a webpage with.
        Below is a list of just some of the content types that a webpage can be populated with using html:

        
        <ul>
            <li>Forms</li>
            <li> Buttons: <button class=buttons, id=button_demo>Click here to interact</button></li>
            <li>Tables</li>
            <li>Images - this includes gifs like the rocket gif in this blogpost</li>
            <li>Navigation bars</li>
            <li>Footers</li>
            <li>Paragraphs</li>
            <li>Headers</li>
            <li>Lists - Both ordered and unordered</li>
        </ul>
